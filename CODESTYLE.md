Codestyle rules
===============

This is a very short manuscript describing the coding style for the **robotflash**
project. To make long story short, the largest project written in C language
is Linux, hence the coding style used there can be named as standard and
orthodox. Hence, follow [this](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/Documentation/process/coding-style.rst)
link to get familiar with Linux and this project codestyle.

NOTE
====

All peripheral and core libraries and used here are not obliged to be in compliance with
the Linux coding style as it might take quite a while to modify and refactor it.
Hopefully it will be fixed in near future.
